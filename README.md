# Project Overview
This site is a class project to make a creative flexbox business website. 
I decided to finish up project idea that I had when I was first getting into web development. 
Which was to make a cross between the Official **TVA(Tennessee Valley Authority)** website and
the fictional **TVA(Time Variance Authority)** from the Loki TV series. 

## Goals.
To make a fun and visually functional flex-box crossover site that just uses **HTML** and **CSS**, and to make it look as close to the actual website as possible.
